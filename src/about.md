## :wave: Hi, I'm Ryan

I'm currently a Junior Developer at the [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) working on the [OneLogin](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk/) project. I am currently based in Putney :deciduous_tree:, in South West London. Previously, I completed a summer internship at the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education). I graduated from the University of Warwick, studying a masters in Chemistry :test_tube:.

- Musings on general [things](/archive)
