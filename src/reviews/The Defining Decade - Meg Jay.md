## An impassioned case to care about your 20s

I recently finished this audiobook after my 24th birthday, and I think future me will remain thankful I did. As I read (or more accurately listened) to this book, I often referred to it as *"a book for my quarter life crisis"*.  Having finished this book, I can now correct this euphemism. Jay does not write to indulge some sense of 20s quarter life crisis. In fact her, and her client's, words can be taken more as a forlorn warning about living your 20s in a passive uncaring fashion. The kind of living spawned by indecision of the *quarter life crisis* mindset.

### Your 20s are special  - and your 30s won't be the same

If there is one key takeaway from this book, it is that **your 30s will not be your 20s, doing something later is not the same as doing it now**. This is a theme that runs through each chapter in the book, filled with the thoughts, worries and jaded realities of Jay's 30 and 40-something clients. The book touches on three main themes: 
**Work**, **Love** and **Brain and Body**. In each theme, Jay provides research backed arguments about the importance your 20s in all of these areas.

### Work: 

In this section, the book covers the many areas of work-life that affects 20-somethings. The book suggests that 20 somethings should make **Intentional Career** choices, even if that means trying a few different things. In your twenties it's vital to explore different pathways and seek work that aligns with your values and overarching vision for your career. The results of your efforts in your 20s might not yield immediately, but they will certainly have a large impact on your career past your 30s. Investment in these years of your career will set the stage for a fulfilling and successful work life beyond your twenties.  


### Love:

In the "Love" section of her book, Meg Jay delves into the intricate world of romantic relationships during the formative years of one's twenties. Central to this discussion is the profound impact these relationships can wield over one's future. Jay passionately urges readers not to settle for unsatisfying partnerships, emphasising that doing so can hinder personal growth and long-term happiness. Instead, she advocates for the pursuit of fulfilling and compatible relationships, even if it means facing the uncertainties and complexities of the dating landscape.

Communication takes centre stage as a pivotal theme in this section. Jay underscores the need for open, honest, and empathetic communication with one's partner. She emphasises that mastering the art of expressing one's needs and concerns while actively listening to their partner can pave the way for healthier, more enduring connections. By nurturing effective communication skills, individuals can navigate the challenges of romantic relationships more successfully, making the most of their twenties as a crucial period for building a strong foundation for love and partnership in the future.

  
### Brain and Body:

In the section on "The Brain and Body," Meg Jay explores the unique cognitive and physical development that characterises one's twenties. This period is marked by remarkable growth and adaptability.

The book highlights that the brain continues to evolve during these years, providing an exceptional opportunity for learning, personal growth, and cognitive development. Simultaneously, the importance of maintaining physical well-being is emphasised. The habits formed during this time can have a lasting impact on overall health. The book encourages readers to adopt a health-conscious lifestyle through regular exercise and balanced nutrition, setting the stage for long-term well-being. In essence, this section serves as a reminder of the significant potential for growth and well-being during one's twenties, emphasising the importance of informed choices for a fulfilling and healthy life.

### Summary: 

This was a really enjoyable book, and the research and practical advice led nature of it helped keep it from feeling too preachy. This has really highlighted the importance of your 20s to me and is definitely something I would recommend to everyone in their twenties.

## Score: 8.5/10
