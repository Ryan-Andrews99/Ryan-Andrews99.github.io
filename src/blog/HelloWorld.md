So this is the beginning of me blogging :wave:. I've never considered myself the blogging type, but here goes. I'll start off with a bit of description of how this website was built. 

## :computer: The tech stack:
This website was built using a static site generator called [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The reasoning behind this choice was twofold: 
- I wanted to bootstrap something quickly, with minimal maintenance. I knew that if I spent forever, devising a **perfect**, *complicated*, and heavy React project I would never get this done. This bare-bones of this website was built over the bank holiday weekend (with most of it done, whilst still recovering from the Saturday)!
- I was already using markdown to store my thoughts in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. This made the case for a markdown rendering SSG much stronger, as I could easily translate things I wanted to publish over to this website. 

The site is minimal, fast and follows a principle I often hear GOV.UK colleagues discuss, that of [**Progressive Enhancement**](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement). Whilst I don't expect this blog to have close to even a fraction of the percentage of traffic the democratic services GDS builds, it is still a principle I think is worth following.

## :art: The design: 

I am not a frontend dev. Frontend development, has so far not scratched the same itch for me that I have found whilst doing backend development here at GDS. So the design of this website reflects that, as well as taking inspiration from some great, slightly sweary websites: 
- [motherFuckingWebsite](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [betterMotherFuckingWebsite](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [evenBetterMotherFuckingWebsite](https://evenbettermotherfucking.website/)

I've also taken some inspiration from one of my fellow Junior Developers on the Graduate Scheme, [Jake](https://jakedanielturner.co.uk/), so here is a shout out! :clap:

## The Vibes: 
At the time of writing, I'm trying to figure out what this blog will be. I still have a private Obsidian vault for my day to day notes. I think the frequency of posting here will try to be *week-to-week*, or more *ad-hoc*. The current conception of this blog is equal parts:
- Somewhere to document my dev journey
- Somewhere to store music and book reviews
- Somewhere to store recipes

However this could easily pan out to be more/less than what I expect it to be currently. If I enjoy blogging, I might extend this into something a bit more *personal*, inspired by my friend Shehzadi's great medium blog [here](https://sheznotes.medium.com/) (another shout out :clap:). I could also end up never revisiting this after a few weeks. I hope this won't be the case. I think I'll try to schedule myself to write regularly.

I'll sign off this post by including a spotify playlist of something I'm currently listening to. Hopefully see you soon! :wave:
