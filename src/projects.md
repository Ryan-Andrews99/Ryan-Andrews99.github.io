## Here are some projects I've recenty worked on:

### [CrimeMapper](https://github.com/alphagov/learning-time-RA-sem1)
A React web app which uses the [Police API](https://data.police.uk/) to map street level crime and stop and search data.

### [Github Data CLI tool](https://github.com/alphagov/learning-time-RA-sem1/)
A command line tool, written in TypeScript, which uses the Github API to gather data about Github Repositories. 

### [Coding Katas](https://github.com/Ryan-Andrews99/coding-katas)
This is a place for me to store code written for coding puzzles (often called katas).

### [This Website](https://github.com/Ryan-Andrews99/Ryan-Andrews99.github.io)
This website, built with eleventy and hosted on Github Pages.
