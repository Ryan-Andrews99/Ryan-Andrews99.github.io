      <h1>👋 🌎 Hello World!</h1> 
    <p>So this is the beginning of me blogging 👋. I've never considered myself the blogging type, but here goes. I'll start off with a bit of description of how this website was built.</p>
<h2>💻 The tech stack:</h2>
<p>This website was built using a static site generator called <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>. The reasoning behind this choice was twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to bootstrap something quickly, with minimal maintenance. I knew that if I spent forever, devising a <strong>perfect</strong>, <em>complicated</em>, and heavy React project I would never get this done. This bare-bones of this website was built over the bank holiday weekend (with most of it done, whilst still recovering from the Saturday)!</li>
<li>I was already using markdown to store my thoughts in an <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> vault. This made the case for a markdown rendering SSG much stronger, as I could easily translate things I wanted to publish over to this website.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is minimal, fast and follows a principle I often hear GOV.UK colleagues discuss, that of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement"><strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong></a>. Whilst I don't expect this blog to have close to even a fraction of the percentage of traffic the democratic services GDS builds, it is still a principle I think is worth following.</p>
<h2>🎨 The design:</h2>
<p>I am not a frontend dev. Frontend development, has so far not scratched the same itch for me that I have found whilst doing backend development here at GDS. So the design of this website reflects that, as well as taking inspiration from some great, slightly sweary websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherFuckingWebsite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">betterMotherFuckingWebsite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://evenbettermotherfucking.website/">evenBetterMotherFuckingWebsite</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've also taken some inspiration from one of my fellow Junior Developers on the Graduate Scheme, <a href="https://jakedanielturner.co.uk/">Jake</a>, so here is a shout out! 👏</p>
<h2>✨ The Vibes:</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, I'm trying to figure out what this blog will be. I still have a private Obsidian vault for my day to day notes. I think the frequency of posting here will try to be <em>week-to-week</em>, or more <em>ad-hoc</em>. The current conception of this blog is equal parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere to document my dev journey</li>
<li>Somewhere to store music and book reviews</li>
<li>Somewhere to store recipes</li>
</ul>
<p>However this could easily pan out to be more/less than what I expect it to be currently. If I enjoy blogging, I might extend this into something a bit more <em>personal</em>, inspired by my friend Shehzadi's great medium blog <a href="https://sheznotes.medium.com/">here</a> (another shout out 👏). I could also end up never revisiting this after a few weeks. I hope this won't be the case. I think I'll try to schedule myself to write regularly.</p>
<p>I'll sign off this post by including a spotify playlist of something I'm currently listening to. Hopefully see you soon! 👋</p>
